## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rabab and I am an aspiring cybersecurity enthusiast majoring in Cybersecurity at Wright State University. Other than my cyber enthusiasm, I have a deep passion in learning about algorithm or high frequency trading as well. For this semester, I look forward to doing two projects. One is based on developing scripts that would be automated to detect malicious code or phishing emails. Another would be building algorithms and using APIs to place trades using a brokerage account when trading opportunities or signals arise.
